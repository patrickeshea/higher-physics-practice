The irradiance I at this distance is displayed on the light meter. This measurement is repeated for a range of different distances. The student uses these results to plot the graph shown. The graph indicates that there is a systematic uncertainty in the experiment. Which of the following alterations would be most likely to reduce the systematic uncertainty in this experiment?",
